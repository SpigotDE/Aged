# Aged
Aged is a challenging medieval based modpack where realism & wisdom rule your life.  

You awaken in the aged wilderness.  
You quickly realize that fresh water and temperature are important for your survival.  
Your character is still weak, so you go an adventure to gather experience to increase your attributes.  
That's where your story begins.
